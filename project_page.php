                                        <h4>General Explanation of Worm gearbox</h4>
<p>A worm gearbox is a mechanic unit, whose main functional components is a gear arrangement consisted of a worm-shaft and a worm-wheel. A worm gear delivers the capability of substantially reducing rotational speed and allowing higher torque to be transmitted. For explanation, with a single start worm, worm-wheel advances only a single tooth of gear by a 360Â° turn of worm-shaft. Therefore, for deploying a single start worm, the gear ratio is "size of the worm-wheel gear divided by 1". For instance, a gearbox of a 18 tooth worm-wheel and a single start worm can reduce the rotational speed by a ratio of 18:1.
</p>
<p>As a compact means of substantial increasing torque by reducing rotational speed, gearbox had been applied to various mechanical systems for translating the mechanical properties in a manipulative manner. For example, electric motors are generally having high-speed and low-torque output. Employing a gearbox can make this line of motors meet the requirements of a wider range of applications.
</p>
<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Our department, Quality Assurance, is requested to inspect the worm-shaft and associated bearing regarding the failure rate of forming transitional fits. The concern about the failure of satisfying the transitional fit between worm-shafts and bearings has arisen after the supply of new parts. This is because that a significant number of produced gearboxes had been reported to fail to pass performance tests. In addition, an increased failure rate of assembling these parts, particular between worm-shafts and bearings, had also been documented in manufacturing department. And, in fact, the worm-shafts and bearings were fabricated by two different companies. In order to avoid failing to meet our quality standards, our department must find out the causing factors.
</p>
<p>In order to answer the claim, there are a number of steps we have to go through with analytic answers. They are:<p>
	
<ol>
<li>Confirm the significance of failure of assembling;</li>
	
<li>If the increased failure rate had been confirmed significant, the manufacturing quality of each type of products must to be inspected regarding if they meet their dimension and tolerance specification;</li>
	
<li>In order to ensure that the quality target can be met, a quality control procedure must to be developed. Therefore, as a long-term solution, acceptable quality limit (AQL) particular needs to be determined and associated sampling plan must be spcified.
</li>
</ol>
